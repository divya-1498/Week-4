# Week-4
Course project: Segment the foreground

For this problem you will be assessed using a randomly chosen selection from the three test images, so it is a good idea to test your algorithm on each of them in MATLAB before submitting here. 
Your code will need to create a mask to accurately segment the foreground (both the coins and blanks) from the background. Use variable name testCoinMask.
Depending on how you segmented the image with all valid coins, the same code may work here, but you'll need to test it to be sure.
